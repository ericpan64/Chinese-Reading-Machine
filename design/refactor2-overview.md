# DuGuo - Refactor 2

## Refactor Goals

Overall, the goal is to have the app ready for deployment (without the actual deployment details).

Initial Checklist:
- Add Bootstrap for initial UI design. Keep it as lightweight as possible while also looking good!
- Add popup dictionary functionality for _all_ Chinese rendered on the screen.
- Add ability to toggle pinyin on/off for a user's saved vocab.
    - See if this can be done _without_ using React
- Add front-end form validation.
- Add appropriate framework for displaying errors to end-users.
- Add appropriate permissions framework for viewing other user information (default all private).
- Ensure document rendering speeds are reasonable.

## Refactor "Nice-to-Have"s
- Add ability to export vocab items to a csv (or similar format).
- Add small library of starter template articles to generate from.
